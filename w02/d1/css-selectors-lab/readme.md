3. 

## Instructions

The assignment instructions are written directly in `index.html`. **Before you make any changes read through the code first!** You'll find comments in the code that will help you explore the difference between CSS Reset and Normalize before you begin working with the CSS selectors.

### Workflow

First you'll need to link `styles.css` to `index.html`.

* Read the exercise instructions in `index.html`
* Write your code in `styles.css`
* Refresh your browser to see if your changes worked
* Repeat for next exercise


## Submit your assignment

Although this not a deliverable, when you're done playing around with this document, if you wish to submit:
1. push your code to your fork of the classwork repo
2. Then, navigate using your browser to your fork of the class repo.
3. Grab the link.
4. Paste the link into the deliverables repo, you may create an "optional" section and submit it there.


## Stretch: Add web fonts to the page

Rather than using a font stack based on built-in fonts, you can use web fonts to broaden the possible fonts and customize your document to your design. Take a look at https://fonts.google.com/ and figure out how to use the fonts listed there in your document.
