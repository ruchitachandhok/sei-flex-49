Task 1. Hamburger

1. Create a webpage with a menu that converts into a hamburger at a certain screen size, such as: <img src="https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/29550/files/cdfd1480-a48a-11ec-81c2-4d47bbf64d8f" />

Task 2. Lightbox position absolute menu

1. Make it so that clicking on the hamburger makes a div pop up that takes up the entire screen, and has an "X" to close the menu
2. Make the "X" work to close the menu. 
3. For example: <img src="https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/29550/files/a2c6f500-a48b-11ec-9b18-94eaaaa0a3a9">

Hints for task 2: you will need to create a div that you will use the dom to show or hide. That div should have "position: absolute" if you want it to overlap others, and probably "left: 0", "right: 0", "top: 0", and "bottom: 0" attributes as well.
